# Sloth Search - A Google-like Search Engine Clone

Sloth Search is a project that aims to recreate Google, including crawling, indexing, and serving results through a user-friendly front-end interface. The project consists of three main components: the Client, Search, and Server.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following folders:

- **Client**: Contains the front-end code, providing a user interface similar to Google search, where users can enter queries and view search results.
- **Search**: Contains the core components of Sloth Search, which replicate the three main parts of Google:
  - **Crawling**: The web crawler that collects information from the web.
  - **Indexing**: Processing and storing the content collected by the crawler for efficient searching.
  - **Serving (PageRank)**: Serving search results based on their relevance and PageRank algorithm.
- **Server**: Contains the search API used to handle client requests and provide search results.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sloth-search
   ```

2. ## Install the necessary Python dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Client Setup**

   - The client contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to run the front-end.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or use a static file server to serve the client code locally.
   - You can also use the live server extension.

4. **Search Setup**

- The `Search` directory contains the code for crawling, indexing, and serving.
- You can start the process by running:
  ```sh
  python search/complete_exmaples/advanced_pagerank.py
  ```
- This will crawl, index, and prepare the content for searching.
- If you want to run any other files do the same process:

```sh
python search/<path to file you want to run>
```

4. **Search Setup**
   - The server uses Flask to provide an API for search queries.
   - Start the Flask server by navigating to the `Server` directory and running:
     ```sh
     python google_search_api.py
     ```

## How It Works

1. **Crawling**

   - The crawler starts with a set of seed URLs and collects links and content from the web.
   - It respects `robots.txt` to avoid being blocked and to ensure ethical crawling.
   - Parsed data is stored in a format ready for indexing.

2. **Indexing**

   - The indexing module processes the crawled pages.
   - The content is tokenized, cleaned, stemmed, and stop words are removed using the NLTK library.
   - The resulting indexed data is saved to be used by the search API.

3. **Serving and PageRank**
   - The PageRank algorithm is used to rank pages based on their importance.
   - When a user searches for a query through the client, the server uses the indexed data and PageRank scores to return the most relevant pages.

## Important Notes

- **Respecting Websites**: The crawler respects `robots.txt` rules. Please make sure not to overload any websites.
- **PageRank Algorithm**: The implementation of the PageRank algorithm uses an iterative approach to rank pages based on the links.
- **Data Storage**: The crawler and indexer use CSV files for data storage (`advanced_pagerank_inverted_index.csv` and `advanced_pagerank.csv`). Make sure these files are writable during execution.
